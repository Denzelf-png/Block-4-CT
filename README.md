Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

My 9th grade programming experince was fun. i remember making a beat or like a song by using wave synthesizer and how we studied sound and made music and read of music notes using coding. I think we made the mario theme ong and then made our own song afterwards.



10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


In Block 1 we made a card shuffle simulator and a programm that rolls die for us using the random library.
In Blocks 2 and 3 we needed to figure out how binary allows us to communicate numbers to computers using  Abstraction. We made 3 videos each videos topic was differents and those topic were Binary and Hexadecimal numbers, How information is transmitted across the Internet, and Virtual Reality Fitness and Mindfulness.


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

I feel like i could improve on how well my program functions from start to finsh, so my functional programming language.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

I think something that challenges me is to be as creavite and give 100% effort i dont do this because i am still kinda new to programming and have a lot to learn so i dont like stepping outside my comfort zone when it comes to programming or fairly new things in general.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

My goal is to just fully understand what i am learning and get more problem solving skils that i may possibly use in my future.
