Hello my name is Denzel Frimpong and I will be explaning in depth what my CT project is about.
My program is a list app.
First we start with the 'Program Goals' this is stating the goals of the program basically stating what  you want the program to do and the goals of the program.

Next we have is 'Import random and My List and unique_list = [] ' Import random “Imports” the random module, which contains a variety of things to do with random number generator.
myList = []  is an empty list of values that can consist of strings, number, floats ; but mainly in this program it’s used to create elements , add elements append elements, and perform many other list functions.The unique() function is used to find the unique elements of an array. Returns the sorted unique elements of an array. ... the indices of the unique array that reconstruct the input array. the number of times each unique value comes up in the input array.

Next we have Def Main Program Def main Program(): Is alo self explanatory it is defining “def” the main function of the program. We put a “while true” statement after this because a while true loop runs forever and is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
 Next we print a greeting as well a prompt that ask the user to pick a number( this number play a big roll in the code). Lastly there's a variable named choice which takes the user data in order to decide where the code goes next.
